# Thermostat #

A single-page JavaScript application modelling a thermostat- temperature can be increased, decreased and reset to a default value, and a power-saving mode can be toggled on and off.

By loading a Sinatra server in the background, the state of the thermostat can be persisted across page refreshes.

### How to use
```
$ git clone git@github.com:i-hardy/thermostat.git
$ cd thermostat
$ bundle
$ rackup
$ open thermostat.html
```
